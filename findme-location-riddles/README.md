# findme-location-riddles Microservice

This microservice is a part of the `findMe` application's backend. It is responsible for the creation and management of location riddles.

In the `findMe` application, users post photos containing a geolocation. Other users then have to guess as precisely as possible where the photo was taken. The closer the guess, the higher the score. This microservice handles the logic related to these location riddles.
